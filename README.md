# Foodie
Foodie is a recipe-sharing app for people with an interest in cooking and baking who'd like to discover new recipe ideas and share their own recipes with others. The purpose of this project is to create a simple, user-friendly app where users can create new recipe entries, browse and search for recipes, and update or delete recipes they've added.<br>
Foodie is a Flask project that uses MongoDB to build a recipe database so that users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their recipes.The long-term goal for this project is to add ecommerce and social features to build an online community of Foodie members and influencers.

## UX <br><br>
My main goal for this project was to create a simple site that is easy to use and that users would want to recommend to their friends. The target audience for this site is people who are interested in cooking, baking, or making drinks, who want to share their own recipes with others or look for inspiration. There is a 'My Recipes' section where the user can see all of the recipes they've added to the site, so they can also store their own recipes in this way. The search feature allows the user to quickly search for a recipe if they are in a hurry at the supermarket, for example, and the 'Add Recipe' and 'Edit Recipe' pages have a minimal UI to allow the user to focus on the different details they need to include for their recipe entry. The lists of recipes displayed for the user on the site show the key details for each recipe so they can quickly scan through it and select the recipe they need based on the title, difficulty level, or time investment.

### Who is this website for?
* People who wish to store and update recipes and recipe images online
* People who'd like to share their recipes with like-minded people
* People who are looking for some inspiration for their cooking or baking projects
* People who are looking for specific recipes<br><br>

### User Stories
As a user, I want to:
* create a Foodie account.
* log in to Foodie.
* navigate easily through the site.
* view recipes that other users have shared.
* view recipes that include all of the details I need to make the dish (ingredients, method, time, temperature, servings).
* search for specific recipes.
* search for recipes with specific ingredients or keywords.
* add my own recipe.
* view the recipes that I have added.
* edit recipes that I have added.
* delete recipes that I have added.
* access the site from a desktop or laptop.
* access the site from a mobile device.
* log out when I've finished browsing or adding recipes.

## Features Left to Implement
**Social Sharing** - I'd like to add 'Quick share' feature for social apps such as WhatsApp and Pinterest for users to easily share recipes.

**Download Recipes** - I'd like to add a PDF or print option to the 'View Recipe' page so that users can save and print recipes.

**Advanced Search** - I'd like to add functionality to allow users to refine and filter search results (e.g. by contributor, meal type, and so on). 

**Contributor Pages**  - I'd like to add contributor/profile pages that users can customize to display their activity and recipes to other users, if they wish. Users would have the option to follow or connect with other Foodie members and tag them or comment on their recipes. This would be a valuable feature for the site owner as they could introduce business pages for food brands and influencers and potentially generate revenue in this way.

**Foodie Forum** - I'd like to add a community forum where Foodie members can ask questions, discuss recipes and share useful baking tips in an informal way.

**Video Tutorials** - I'd like to add a section with video tutorials to demonstrate different cooking and baking techniques. This could include videos submitted by users as well as some premium content from well known chefs and bakers.
