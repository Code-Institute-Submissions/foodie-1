# Foodie
Foodie is a recipe-sharing app for people with an interest in cooking and baking who'd like to discover new recipe ideas and share their own recipes with others. The purpose of this project is to create a simple, user-friendly app where users can create new recipe entries, browse and search for recipes, and update or delete recipes they've added.<br>
Foodie is a Flask project that uses MongoDB to build a recipe database so that users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their recipes.The long-term goal for this project is to add ecommerce and social features to build an online community of Foodie members and influencers.

## UX <br><br>
My main goal for this project was to create a simple site that is easy to use and that users would want to recommend to their friends. The target audience for this site is people who are interested in cooking, baking, or making drinks, who want to share their own recipes with others or look for inspiration. There is a 'My Recipes' section where the user can see all of the recipes they've added to the site, so they can also store their own recipes in this way. The search feature allows the user to quickly search for a recipe if they are in a hurry at the supermarket, for example, and the 'Add Recipe' and 'Edit Recipe' pages have a minimal UI to allow the user to focus on the different details they need to include for their recipe entry. The lists of recipes displayed for the user on the site show the key details for each recipe so they can quickly scan through it and select the recipe they need based on the title, difficulty level, or time investment.
